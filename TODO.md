### TODO
+ Add a comments interface/modal (with a spellchecker? Preview post?)

+ Monitor status of all components and defer kbs/loaded event until
all components have finished initialising, more reliable than hard coding
the event fire (maybe combine with the repository component?)

+ Might want to add max length parameters for the console.
Maybe as a config option?

+ Add a badge to tasks with comments? Is there a way to show when new
comments arrive?

+ Somewhat related to above, a possibility to have a notifications system
would be great. Maybe go as far as to allow tasks to be "followed".

+ Add a general notification for tasks that are marked as "TYPE: To Discuss"
