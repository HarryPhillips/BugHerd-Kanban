# Kanban
BugHerd Kanban improvements and future MIS integration tool.
Written as a Greasemonkey userscript, compiled into a standalone Firefox Plugin.

## Installation
There are two ways to install Kanban, hosting the source on your local server or
using the raw GitHub direct links.

The local server option requires you to host the repository in a directory
accessible via a http://localhost/ URL. This is so Kanban can pull the required
scripts and inject them into the page.

Using the raw GitHub links may be slower but it means you always get the latest
updates automatically and all you need to do is install Kanban.xpi to Firefox.

### Notice:
When using the raw GitHub links, please use this URL otherwise MIME Type errors may occur:
