# Kanban
BugHerd Kanban improvements and future MIS integration tool.
Written as a Greasemonkey userscript, compiled into a standalone Firefox Plugin.

## Installation
To install Kanban, currently you need to download the repository and unzip it into
a directory accessible via a http://localhost URL.

Install the .xpi file from /dist to Firefox and change the Base Url setting
under the extension options to point to that directory.
